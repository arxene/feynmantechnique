# The Feynman Technique

The Feynman technique is a study technique where you are encouraged to think about how you'd explain a topic to someone who has no idea about it, perhaps to a child.

It's an iterative process.

1. Describe topic
2. Check which parts you don't understand and fill in your knowledge gaps
3. Reword it or add pictures so that even a child could understand the topic

Repeat until you could explain the topic to someone without using any technical terms or jargon.
